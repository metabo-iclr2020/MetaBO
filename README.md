# MetaBO - Meta-Learning Acquisition Functions for Transfer Learning in Bayesian Optimization
This is the source code accompanying the paper *Meta-Learning Acquisition Functions for Transfer Learning in Bayesian Optimization* by Volpp et al., ICLR 2020. The paper can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02642). The code allows to reproduce the results from the paper and to train neural acquisition functions on new problems.

***PLEASE NOTE: THE CODE HAS BEEN MOVED TO A NEW REPOSITORY AT*** [boschresearch](https://github.com/boschresearch/MetaBO)
